# Example: one run of the mini agent on Bija, forked and graded

`trajectory.tar.gz` is a complete alaya data directory — the states, the restic repository of
their workspaces, and the model cache — holding a run of `Alaya.Agent.MiniSwe` on the Bija benchmark (`bija/`), a fork
with a hand-made intervention, and a grader's verdict on both branches. `report.html` is its
report, a single file to open in a browser. To use the commands below, unpack the archive first:

```sh
mkdir -p example/trajectory && tar -xzf example/trajectory.tar.gz -C example/trajectory
```

It shows, on a real task, what the four documentation pages describe: every model turn and
workspace snapshot recorded as an immutable state, a person changing the workspace and telling
the agent so, and a grader scoring a state the agent could never continue from.

## What it shows

```
76d880264177  root      the task and the skeleton of the Bija project
  ...         10 turns  the agent reads SPEC.md, writes src/bija/cli.py, runs sample programs
  dba0adb1cd03  turn    three sample programs still fail to parse
    87fc41d3653f  submit   [Submitted] "I'm out of time for a complete spec pass"
      5f64ce1f762d  eval   [fail 29/232]
    e5b6526f4f78  commit   a person fixes three parser bugs by hand and tells the agent
      ...           4 turns  the agent rewrites the file and breaks it
      11b903989e82  submit   [Submitted] "Partially updated src/bija/cli.py"
        e786d0c2fe1e  eval   [fail 0/232]
```

The first branch is the agent's own run: eleven model turns, ending in a submission that the
agent itself describes as incomplete. Against the reference suite's 232 programs it scores 29.

The second branch starts from the same state the submission did. The person checked out that
state, fixed three parser bugs in `src/bija/cli.py` (statements begin with an expression, the
literals `yes`/`no`/`void` and the `depth` keyword were never consumed), and committed the
result with a message saying what was fixed, what remained, and that there was no time limit.
The agent read the message, rewrote the whole file in one command, produced an indentation
error, and submitted again after four turns. That state scores 0 of 232: the file no longer
parses.

Both verdicts hang off the states they judge, as leaves, and each one's workspace is the checkout
as the grader left it: the 232 reference programs in place of the 12 samples. No state the agent
ran from ever held them.

## How it was produced

From the repository root, with `alaya` built (`lake build`) and on the `PATH`, starting from an
empty `example/trajectory`. The agent ran in
`ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.12-alpine3.23` without network access, the default; the model was
`gpt-5.4-mini` at temperature 0 through the xmcp provider. The run predates restic snapshots: the
archive is that run with every workspace moved into a restic repository, which changed the
state hashes and nothing else, and the hashes here are the archive's.

```sh
D=example/trajectory
M=xmcp:closeai/gpt-5.4-mini

# The root: the task statement and the skeleton, pinned to the image.
root=$(alaya root --task-file example/bija/TASK.txt example/bija/skeleton --agent agents/mini-swe-default.json \
  --image ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.12-alpine3.23 --data $D)

# The first branch, to its submission.
alaya resume $root --model $M --data $D
# ... 87fc41d3653f  [Submitted]

# Grade it against the reference suite.
alaya eval 87fc41d3653f --grader 'example/bija/grade.py {checkout} {out}' --timeout 1800 --data $D
# 5f64ce1f762d  fail 1 29/232  (76971 ms)

# The intervention: check out the last turn before the submission, edit by hand, commit with a message.
alaya checkout dba0adb1cd03 /tmp/fix --data $D
$EDITOR /tmp/fix/src/bija/cli.py
alaya commit dba0adb1cd03 /tmp/fix -m "Hand fix: expression-first statements, literal keywords, depth" \
  --tell "I fixed three parser bugs in src/bija/cli.py by hand. ..." --data $D
# e5b6526f4f78

# The second branch, from the intervention, and its verdict.
alaya resume e5b6526f4f78 --model $M --data $D
# ... 11b903989e82  [Submitted]
alaya eval 11b903989e82 --grader 'example/bija/grade.py {checkout} {out}' --timeout 1800 --data $D
# e786d0c2fe1e  fail 1 0/232  (6993 ms)
```

## Reading it

```sh
D=example/trajectory
alaya tree --data $D                                  # the tree above
alaya show e5b6526f4f78 --data $D                     # the intervention: message, log, workspace
alaya diff dba0adb1cd03 e5b6526f4f78 --data $D        # what the person changed
alaya show 5f64ce1f762d --data $D                     # the verdict and the grader's output
alaya checkout 5f64ce1f762d /tmp/evidence --evidence --data $D   # verdict.json, junit.xml, pytest.txt
alaya html example/report.html --hide .venv --hide __pycache__ --data $D
```

The archive holds only the durable parts of the data directory (`docs/trajectory-schema.md`
§5): the state files, the restic repository, and the model cache. The screenshot is the report with the
intervention state selected, taken by `screenshot.py`:

```sh
example/screenshot.py $PWD/example/report.html example/trajectory.png 1280 780 e5b6526f4f78
```

The model cache is part of the data directory, so removing a branch with `alaya rm` and
resuming its parent again replays the recorded turns from the cache, without a request to the
provider. Continuing from a state that already has a turn child is a new draw, and needs the
provider and `XMCP_API_KEY`.

## What the run says about the agent

The agent measured itself by the sample programs it could run directly and never ran the suite:
`uv run pytest` needs to download pytest, and the container has no network by default. It
declared itself out of time on both branches; the mini agent has no time limit, and the
intervention said so. The rewrites that broke the file were single `cat > file <<'PY'` commands
of a few hundred compressed lines, a habit the intervention did not change.
