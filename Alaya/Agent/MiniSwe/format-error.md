Tool call error:

<error>
{{error}}
</error>

Here is general guidance on how to submit correct toolcalls:

Every response needs to use the 'bash' tool at least once to execute commands.

Call the bash tool with your command as the argument:
- Tool: bash
- Arguments: {"command": "your_command_here"}

If you want to end the task, please issue the following command: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`
without any other command.
