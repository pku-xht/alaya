fixtures (`Test/MiniFixtures.lean`) are rendered by mini's own jinja templates, so the prompts
are checked against upstream to the byte, except for the port's `submit` tool and its optional
recorded-output recovery policy. End-to-end cases drive the real agent over a snapshotted workspace with
a scripted model. -/
